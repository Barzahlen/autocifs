# AutoCIFS Configuration

# The path to the AutoCIFS script location
# Default: /usr/local/bin/autocifs.sh
SCRIPTPATH="/usr/local/bin/autocifs.sh"

# Set the log level
# LOGLEVEL=2 debug, LOGLEVEL=1 normal logging, LOGLEVEL=0 disabled
# Default: 1
LOGLEVEL=1

# The hostname or IP address of the CIFS Server
# Can be an resolvable DNS Name like "cifsserver.example.com"
# or an IP like "10.10.10.2"
FILESERVER="cifsserver.example.com"

# The CIFS protocol version used for the server checks and mounting
# Since the checks are being performed with smbclient it needs a different version format
# than mount for actually mounting the CIFS Share.
# Default for CIFSVERSCHECK: SMB2 (can be NT1 (latest SMB1), SMB2 or SMB3 (req. Win 2012 Server and up))
# Default for CIFSVERSMOUNT: 2.1 (can be 2.0, 2.1, 3.0 and some others)
CIFSVERSCHECK="SMB2"
CIFSVERSMOUNT="2.1"

# User for the CIFS Share
USERNAME="Guest"

# Password for the CIFS Share
PASSWORD="itsasecret"

# Server Check interval (in seconds)
# Default: 60 seconds
INTERVAL=60

# The shares that need to be mounted defined as an array
# Example with 2 shares: MOUNTS=( "/mnt/share" "/var/remoteShare2|/var/localShare2" )
# Explanation: AutoCIFS will try to mount both shares whereas in the second
# mountpoint there are a different remote and local mountpoint which are divided by
# the MOUNTSDELIMITER below. The default is the pipe.
MOUNTS=( "/mnt/share" )
MOUNTSDELIMITER="|"

# Prerequisites:
# AutoCIFS needs some external tools to work properly
# and they're defined in the following array. It's made user-editable
# in case you want to modify it or change/remove dependencies.
# CAUTION: Normally you don't have to change anything unless you know what you're doing!
ACIFSDEP[1]='smbclient'
ACIFSDEP[2]='mount'
ACIFSDEP[3]='umount'
ACIFSDEP[4]='sleep'
